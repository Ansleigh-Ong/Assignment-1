# Front-End Development Assignment 1: Website – Online Flower Shop

The website is for a flower shop brand named **‘Cloverene’**, allowing customers to browse the flower shop's catalogue before ordering. Users can browse through the flower catalogue before ordering. Users need to log in to purchase items. The rest of the pages like **About-Us** and **Support** is to enhance user experience in the website while giving the brand a good image.

## Design Process:

Since it is a flower shop, I decided to go for a flora theme, matching the color scheme with green and brown, symbolizing flowers and pollen colors. For the logo, I created a simple design featuring the name paired with a clover, symbolizing good luck and leaving a positive impression.

- **User Perspective**: Users start at the shopping page for easy access to products. User can see all the good things about the brand when in other pages like **About Us**
- **Brand Perspective**: Pages like **About Us** and **Support** help enhance the brand's image so that customers are more willing to spend their money on their products.
