# Front-End Development Assignment 1: Website – Online Flower Shop

The website is for a flower shop brand named **‘Cloverene’**, allowing customers to browse the flower shop's catalogue before ordering. Users can browse through the flower catalogue before ordering. Users need to log in to purchase items. Other pages like **About Us** and **Support** enhance the user experience and give the brand a positive image.

## Design Process:

Since it is a flower shop, I decided to go for a flora theme, matching the color scheme with green and brown, symbolizing flowers and pollen colors. For the logo, I created a simple design featuring the name paired with a clover, symbolizing good luck and leaving a positive impression.

- **User Perspective**: Users start at the shopping page for easy access to products. 
- **Brand Perspective**: Pages like **About Us** and **Support** aim to enhance the brand's image.
